MAC Address Lookup API
_____________________


This will enable users to look-up the name of the company by entering the mac-id as a parameter via the command line. 
The mac-id is queried against https://macaddress.io.
Go to the folder src-file ---

Steps to follow to run the code:-

You will need to have your API key handy and export it as an environment variable with the variable name API_K (This is the security measure as you don't want to risk exposing your API key)
```
export API_K
```
In the command line, run 
```
bash setup.sh
```
This will setup the environment for docker.
